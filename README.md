# Weak Supervision for News Classification

In this project, we are using Snorkel Python to work with ML algorithms on an unlabeled text dataset. The unlabeled dataset is labeled with labeling functions that we build.

The dataset that we use is a Turkish News Dataset which consists of 1150 news from 5 different classes. For our weak supervision project, we did not use these labels.
